# Question 1
Django is very managed, compared to Flask, which is very bare bones.  Django provides lots of libraries and fleshes out a much larger,
more robust project structure that allows for extendibility for full-stack projects, whereas Flask handles more so quick and easy backend projects,
like setting up a simple RESTful API.

# Question 2
REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. **

# Question 3
CRUD stands for Create Read Update Delete.
C(reate) -> POST
R(ead) -> GET
U(pdate) -> PUT/PATCH
D(elete) -> DELETE

# Question 4
As per https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status:
1.xx -> Informational responses (ie. additional information)
2.xx -> Successful responses (ie.  it worked! here's the response)
3.xx -> Redirection responses (ie. request for this elsewhere)
4.xx -> Client-side error responses (ie. client made a weird request)
5.xx -> Server-side error responses (ie. something wrong happened in backend)

# Question 5
From https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/:
An XSS attack (aka cross site scripting) is when a malicious script is sent to a client, and gets executed by the browser because it thinks
the source is a trusted source. 

An example could be where a malicious user writes JavaScript code inside of an <input> element on a website and it gets executed. 

# Question 6
CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
You'll need CORS protection when your site makes requests to domains other than your own. A good example of this will be the group project in this class!
